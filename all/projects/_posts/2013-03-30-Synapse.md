title: Synapse
snippet: Built for 1 Game a Month. Abstract platformer featuring procedural audio and lots of odd visual effects. Unity3D and Pure-Data (for audio)
---

Synapse was a bit of a weird project. Built for 1 Game a Month March, our only objective was to produce a game that could integrate Pure-Data (a visual programming language for procedural audio) with Unity3D.

The end result is a weird mix of odd sounds which are influenced by the user's actions, and whatever visual effects I thought looked cool at the time. The gameplay is very simple: simply collect the black cubes (power sources) and bring them to the spindly receptacles (synapses). 

I recommend turning your speakers down when you first launch the game, the sounds are rather abrasive, as we just had fun playing around with pure data, as opposed to focusing on not blowing out your speakers.
