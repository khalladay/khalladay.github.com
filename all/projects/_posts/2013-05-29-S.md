title: S
snippet: A first-person abstract puzzle game, built for the Swedish Game Awards with Unity3D.
---

S is an abstract puzzle game, with a lot of inspiration taken from the game Kairo. The objective was to take a music toy that Johannes had built and turn it into a game. Players walk through an abstract environment and solve puzzles by creating cubes that emit sound and placing them where needed. Visually, the game is largely monochromatic, and a lot of effort was put into creating something that was visually interesting despite having no 2D or 3D artists on the team. 

Game design wise, this was both my first foray into first person games, and abstract puzzle design. A much longer discussion of producing S can be found here.

Due to the very tight timeline we were working under, the game is much less stable than I would have liked it to be when we wrapped up work on it, but it is fully playable. The majority of the bugs seem to occur when the water is moving downwards. For best results, allow the water to stop moving before descending.
