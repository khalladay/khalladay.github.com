Zen Burnt was built for Bacon Jam 7! It was the smallest project I had worked on in forever, and probably one of the most fun as well (those 2 data points are likely related in some way...).

In any case, there isn't too much to tell about this game, if you're interested in a look into how the weekend jam went, you can check out the post [here](http://kylehalladay.com/all/blog/2014/03/24/Bacon-Jam-And-Vertex-Colours.html), otherwise happy cooking! :D
