title: Bird Flew
snippet: A gyroscope controlled avoidance game for iOS, built with cocos2D. Features seeking and fleeing ai behaviours.
---

Bird Flew is a gyroscope controlled avoidance game for iOS. It was built for the 2nd Great Canadian Appathon, over the course of 48 hours. Using gyroscope controls, players must tilt their phones to steer a skydiver away from murderous geese that are attempting to collide with them. 

The geese feature 2 different seeking behaviours, allowing them to more intelligently attempt to collide with the player. Should you find yourself surrounded with no way out, look for a cloud puff, hitting on of those will cause all the geese on screen to flee, buying you precious seconds to get into a better position.
