snippet: A word game for iOS featuring procedurally generated levels and dynamically scaled difficulty. Built entirely in OpenGLES.
---

WordGhoul is a word game for iOS, featuring procedurally generated, fast paced gameplay. Users are tasked with finding a specified number of words in a grid of letters before time runs out.

In order to more intelligently scale the levels to the current level the user is on, the game attempts to solve the puzzle as itâ€™s generated. Once the game knows how many words there are total in the grid, it scales that down to the number of words the player must find to advance to the next level.

**Technologies Used: ** Objective-C, OpenGLES

**Team Members: **  Kyle Halladay (Game Design, Programming), Eugene Bycok (Music Composition/Production)
