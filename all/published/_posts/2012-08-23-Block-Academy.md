Block Academy is an iOS augmented reality puzzle game. Using a marker card and the iPhoneâ€™s camera, the game appears as though it is being played in real space. 

Users are tasked with building shapes defined by translucent 3D blueprints displayed above their table or desk. There are three types of blocks available to the user, each of which interacts with other blocks differently. In order to complete each level, the user must master these block to block interactions.

Block Academy also features a sandbox mode, which gives users an unlimited number of blocks to place, and the ability to change the colours of those blocks.
