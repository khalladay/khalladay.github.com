One of the things I struggle with a lot is perfectionism. I have a hard time starting a new (personal) projects without being absolutely convinced that what I'm making will live up to my standards. This makes it very difficult for me to start new games.

I end up spending a whole lot of time with a notebook writing down ideas which I very quickly discard, and don't ever sink my teeth into things. It is (or at least was) very frustrating. My options seemed to be to keep going with One Game a Month and create projects which didn't live up to the types of things I wanted to create, or get stuck doing nothing while staring at scribble of ideas that never went anywhere.

I started learning shader/graphics programming, in the hope that having more graphical options available to me would lead me to a new project. What ended up happening was that I discovered that I really, really like graphics programming. So rather than beat myself up for not coming up with a game idea I like, I've decided to push forward with shaders and graphics for as long as that feels like fun and not work, and hope that along the way I stumble into a game idea, or another new direction to head. 

So, as you may have noticed, I've added another section to this site, the Graphics section, where I'll showcase any graphics stuff that I'm particularly proud of. The first thing posted there is a blur effect for Unity Pro. It's all open source, grab the repo and play around with it (or improve it) if you'd like, and expect more to follow.

As always, I'm easily contactable [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/khalladay), especially if you've noticed something about the blur effect that could be done better, or you have stories or advice regarding writer's block as it pertains to game. Folk remedies are very welcome.
