title: Down The Rabbit Hole
---

One of the main reasons why I think I click so much with graphics code is the easy parallel from writing a cool shader or graphics demo and more traditional artistic mediums. I'm a big proponent of video games being art, but they're definitely (usually) a much more collaborative medium. Making games is a lot of work, and to do it as one person is a herculean feat. Graphics code, because it is more focused, is much more easily compared to painting or composing music.

Looking at graphics code as art led me to the demo scene. Two days of watching demos later I decided I needed to figure out how to do that kind of thing too, and thus began my free-fall into the world of procedural graphics. 

Huge thanks to [IÃ±igo Quilez](http://www.iquilezles.org), his website is amazing, and his comments on my first procedural graphics shader on shadertoy.com [(link)](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xdl3zB) have been tremendously helpful. From what I can tell, the guy just really really digs this sort of stuff, and loves helping other people out.

I've also been playing around with shaders, largely for a project at work, but also while working through the rest of the Unity Cookie tutorials. Nothing amazing yet, but I'm getting pretty comfortable with writing basic shaders; it's a really cool feeling to need a shader while at work and being able to whip it up in a few minutes. Granted, optimizing them for mobile is still something that I struggle with, but I'm learning as I go.

Finally, I've started playing some smaller games to start getting ideas floating about what is a reasonable scope of a 1-2 person project. I play a lot of the larger AAA and indie games, and I think it's made me expect far too much from projects that I work on. So far I've checked out Splice, Solar 2, Auditorium, and gone back to AAAaaAAaAAa. It's been very refreshing, and I find myself thinking about, and getting excited about, much smaller ideas. Going back to the first paragraph of this post, the real magic of solo game dev is being happy with making a micro scale game, and playing games of that scale is really helping. 

I'm also toying with the idea of adding a unity shader section to the graphics, just to dump all these little shaders I'm making in case they help someone else out.
