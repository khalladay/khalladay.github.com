title: S&#58; Making an Abstract Puzzle Game
---

After February, [Johannes](http://johannesg.com/index.html) and I both agreed that we weren't having as much fun with 1 Game a Month as we had hoped. Largely, this was due to both of our schedules being too hectic to really work with such a short deadline. So we decided to drop out of 1GAM and work on stuff at a pace that made sense to us. 

Or...that was the plan. 

We started to take a project that Johannes built while at school and flesh it out a bit. For the most part, the game was an interactive music toy, and our work ended up focusing on turning that toy into a more traditional game. It was a really interesting design exercise; I'm usually the one pushing for more whimsical design choices, but I ended up spending most of my time arguing for mechanics to be put in, while Johannes fought to preserve a lot of the sandbox feel of the original game. It worked better than it sounds. Taking opposite viewpoints meant that both of us had to justify things we wanted to add (or not add) to the game.

Our schedules being what they are, it took us about a month to really hammer down what we wanted to do with the game. Around that time, Johannes also happened to notice that we were about a month out from the submission deadline for the Swedish Game Awards. We both suddenly forgot that we didn't like working to deadlines. 

So, on May 29th, we submitted S. The game is rather buggy (lesson learned: don't decide to add swimming to a game at the 11th hour), but it's probably the most visually interesting project I've worked on to date. If you're interested, you can grab it here: ([Windows](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6128167/Windows.zip) | [Mac](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6128167/S.zip)). If you do, I recommend letting the water sink all the way to the bottom before jumping when the time arises. Riding the water down has a tendency to REALLY bug out.

I'm pretty sure that I finally learned my lesson about short deadlines (namely: don't do them). It was a grind trying to squeeze in as much dev time as possible on this while also balancing it with how busy things get at work. The end result isn't nearly as stable as I would like, but it is what it is. Learned a lot from it, happy I did it, excited to move on. 

Finally, in the grand tradition of how I end projects, here are the big things that I learned making S: <br>

<h4>1 - <strong>Proportion is a big deal in first person games. </strong></h4>
This was the first game I've made with a first person camera. I had no idea how hard it would be to scale objects and environments in order to feel right. We certainly could have done a lot more with S in this regard given more time, and I probably will do a whole post just on this sometime in the future.

<h4>2 - <strong>Abstract puzzles are all about communication</strong></h4>
Creating puzzles that telegraph what the player needs to do without giving away how to do it is tricky to do right. Based on feedback that I've gotten from a few players, a few of our puzzles really didn't do this well. We needed to spend a lot more time figuring out ways to teach the player what to do in each puzzle. Again, this probably warrants its own post once I play with this idea a bit more. 

<h4>3 - <strong>Blurring out distant objects is a surprisingly good way to pull players forward. </strong></h4>
One of the biggest parts of the visual style of S is the blurring of objects far away from you (not true fog, but it has the same effect). It started out as a way to make our rather simple environment meshes more interesting, but it also ended up being a pretty good way to direct players. People have a tendency to want to see a blurred object come into focus, so teaching them that moving towards something will unblur it ended up being a pretty cool way to make sure players wanted to go forward.

Anyways, that's all for now. If you want to share any thoughts about the game or anything I've written, send me a message [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/khalladay)!
