<p>I upgraded my phone to iOS 4.1 yesterday excited to check out the HDR performance.  Here are some terribly boring comparative shots. Move your mouse over to compare.
</p>

<div class="compare">
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0803.JPG" alt="Regular" />
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0804.JPG" alt="HDR" />
</div>
<p>
  There is more detail in both the shadows and the highlights. Above the text is sharper in the regular photo.
</p>       
<div class="compare">               
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0805.JPG" alt="Regular" />
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0806.JPG" alt="HDR" />
</div>                              
<div class="compare">               
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0807.JPG" alt="Regular" />
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0808.JPG" alt="HDR" />
</div>                              
<div class="compare">               
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0809.JPG" alt="Regular" />
  <img src="/images/photos/IMG_0810.JPG" alt="HDR" />
</div>
<p>
  It's not perfect but pretty impressive and very cool. I think comparing the HDR versions to the regular version is cool but I'll post some comparisons with my wife's Powershot to see how HDR on the iPhone stacks up to a dedicated compact camera.
