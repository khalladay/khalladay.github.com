<p>I've admired many an iPhone stand. I've considered buying several but I knew I wouldn't want to carry them around with me. This morning I woke up and realized that I have a stand already. I almost always have it with me—in fact you could say that I “never leave home without it.”

<p>That's right! You can just shove a credit card, gift card, blood donor card, etc. up into the bumper and it stands.

<p>Disclaimer: You need a bumper case. It's a little fragile.</p>
