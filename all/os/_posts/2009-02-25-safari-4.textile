p. You can read elsewhere how fast Safari 4 is.  I just have one suggestion regarding the "Top Sites" feature: the button should toggle like the booksmark button next to it.  One click: show top sites, click again: show the page you were on before you clicked.

p. Note: Currently you _can_ click the back button if you need to get back.

p. Tip: If you want to re-order your tabs you have to grab the tab by the little grippy part:
