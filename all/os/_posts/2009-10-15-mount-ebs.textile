p. I use RightScale to manage my EC2 environment. I recently was unable to create a bundle of one of my servers and discovered the problem was I was running out of disk space.  I was using 2.7GB of 10GB but the bundle image would use up the rest of the disk and fail.  How can you get more space? Elastic Block Storage (ESB).

h3. Step 1: Create & Attach ESB

p. In RightScale click "Clouds" then Navigate to AWS US -> EBS Volumes - New.  Fill out the form (I needed 10GB - it will also be easier to follow along here if you choose /dev/sdm).  Navigate to the volume you created and click the "Attach" button. This will allow you to choose a server.

h3. Step 2: Format & Mount

p. Follow steps here: "how format and mount ebs volume":https://learningspaces.njit.edu/content/how-format-and-mount-ebs-volume. Except mount to /mnt instead of /data.  If you do mount to data you can also mount to /mnt without issue: mount /dev/sdm /mnt

h3. Step 3: Create Bundle

p. Navigate to your server in RightScale and click the bundle button.  It should work now.  You can monitor your disk space on your server using the "df -h" command.
