<p>I created a quick webiste mock up last night... I'm not a designer :(</p>

<p>I created the mock up in photoshop then copied the design to HTML + CSS.  Photoshop has a feature that makes all letters upper case with the truly capitalized ones bigger and the lower case letters smaller.  I found that CSS allows for this same behavior.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.3em">Regular: The United States of America</p>

<p style="font-size:1.3em">Small caps: <span style="font-variant:small-caps">The United States of America</span></p>

<p>Here is a css class definition for small caps:</p>

<pre name="code" class="css">
font-variant:small-caps;
</pre>
