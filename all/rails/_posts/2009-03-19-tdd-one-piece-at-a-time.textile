p. <img src="/images/fish-puzzle.jpg" alt="boy putting puzzle together" style="float:right; padding:10px; margin-right:-100px;" />When I give my 20 month-old son all the pieces to his fish puzzle he just mixes them up and flings them around.  When I keep all the pieces and give them to him one at a time he will place them into the hole with the matching color. 

p. I think he gets overwhelmedâ€“ can a boy that young be "overwhelmed?".  Let's say he gets distracted by all his options.  I get overwhelmed/distracted too! 

p. One of the reasons test driven development has resonated so strongly with me is that I'm forced to break problems down into small pieces. Once the problems are small enough I can put the pieces in the right holes.

p. p.s. - This photo reminds me of how badly I need to bust out my real camera and make some images.
