Q. What happens when you include two modules that define the same method in one class?

A. The method in the module added last is called!

<notextile><pre name="code" class="ruby">
module Tiger
  def talk
    "prrrrr!"
  end
end
module Lion
  def talk
    "roar!"
  end
end

class Liger
  include Lion
  include Tiger
end

class Tigon
  include Tiger
  include Lion
end

tigon = Tigon.new
puts "a tigon says #{tigon.talk}"

liger = Liger.new
puts "a liger says #{liger.talk}"
</pre></notextile>

<notextile>
<pre class="terminal">
$ ruby cats.rb
a tigon says roar!
a liger says prrrrr!
</pre>
</notextile>
