<p>The top three google links I got for this seemed to require a lot of junk I didn't think I needed.  I kept searching and found that it is exactly as ridiculously simple as I have come to expect from Ruby:</p>

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
require 'md5'
puts Digest::MD5.hexdigest("This is what I want to hash")
</pre>
