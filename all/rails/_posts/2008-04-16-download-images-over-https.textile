<p>Long post title.<br/>

Today I found myself with a text file of image names that needed to be downloaded from a site.  This is how I did it:</p>

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
require 'net/http'
require "net/https"

@http=Net::HTTP.new('www.domain.com', 443)
@http.use_ssl = true

# open file with file names for reading only - my file names were one per line
image_list = File.new("imagenames.txt", "r")  

#start our web session:
@http.start() do |http|
  image_list.each do |file_name|
    # remove any extra \r or \n chars
    file_name.chomp!

    #only download if we don't already have it:
    unless File.exists? "images/#{file_name}"
      # status message:
      print "downloading #{file_name}..."

      # set up the request
      req = Net::HTTP::Get.new("/images/#{file_name}")
      response = http.request(req)
      # write the binary data to the local file of the same name:
      open("images/#{file_name}","wb").write( response.body )

      puts "DONE!"
    else
      puts "skipping: #{file_name}"
    end
  end

end
</pre>
