	My first venture into programming was Lego Logo in the fifth grade, on a computer that was already ancient at the time. It was apparent by about the second recess that I skipped to spend more time at the terminal that I would end up working with computers in one way or another.

	My passion is working outside the box. I’m happiest, and at my best, when I’m trying (and sometimes succeeding) at doing things that no one else is doing, regardless of whether that means working with new technology, or trying out game ideas that are off the beaten track.

	I’m of the firm belief that video games are a misunderstood art form. They provide the possibility for creating powerful, personal experiences unique to every person who plays a game, and (at least at the moment), my personal projects are my explorations into this idea.

	When I’m not coding, I’m usually found on a piano, accompanied by a cup of coffee, or seeking out the spiciest food I can find.

	Currently, I live in Toronto, Ontario, where I work as a Unity3D and Augmented Reality programmer.
