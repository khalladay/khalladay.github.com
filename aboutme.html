<h2>About Me</h2>

<div id="post">
	<br>
	I'm a game programmer from Toronto, Ontario. Making games is what I love to do, especially when I'm making off beat, or just plain weird ones. I get excited by trying new (usually absurd) things, and a lot of what I make reflects that. I'm also very interested in procedural graphics.

	I do a lot of work with Unity3D, it's great and makes my life a lot easier. Outside of my personal projects, I work as a Unity3D and iOS developer. I've also been known to dabble with Ogre3D, cocos2D, and raw OpenGL.
