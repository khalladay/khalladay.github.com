<h2>About Me</h2>
</span>

<div id="post">
	<br>
	I'm a game programmer from Toronto, Ontario. Making games is what I love to do, especially when I'm making off beat, or just plain weird ones. I get excited by trying new (usually absurd) things, and a lot of what I make reflects that. For me, the best part of making games is getting opportunities to create meaningful, or thoughtful, interactive experiences, and then cramming those experiences full of really cool graphics code.

	I do a lot of work with Unity3D, but have been known to dip into Ogre3D and coco2D and plain OpenGL. I'm also a big fan of Cg and GLSL, love writing C/C++, and am fascinated by shader and graphics techniques. When I'm not programming (it happens sometimes, I swear) you can find me at my piano, or playing Mtg.
