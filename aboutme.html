<h2>About Me</h2>
</span>

<div id="post">
	<br>
	I'm a graphics programmer from Toronto, Ontario. During the day, I write effects and tools that enable programmers and visual artists to make cooler looking stuff. By night, I tinker with ray/path tracers and build stuff that's fun to stare at and interact with. 
	
	My favourite coordinate system is NDC space. The fact that I have a favourite coordinate system probably tells you everything you need to know about me :D
	
	Currently I'm at [Norm Li AG+I](http://normli.ca) working on shaders / graphics code for interactive architectural visualization systems built with Unity.
