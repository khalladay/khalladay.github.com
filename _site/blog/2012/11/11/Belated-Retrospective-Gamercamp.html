<h1 class="title">A Belated Retrospective on Gamercamp 2012</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>So I know I’m a little late writing about it, but 2 weeks ago I spent my weekend speaking at, and attending, Gamercamp 2012. I spoke as part of the emerging artists’ showcase, which means that I had the oddly difficult task of talking about myself for 10 minutes in front of a theater full of people waiting for Vander Caballero’s talk on the design philosophy of Papo &amp; Yo (Vander is an amazing speaker, and you need to go play Papo &amp; Yo right now).</p>

<p>Talking about yourself is weird. In the past two months I’ve had the chance to do a heck of a lot more public speaking than I ever imagined I would have to as a programmer, but I was always speaking about something technical. Trying to talk about yourself and be interesting is no small feat, and I wussed out at trying. I ended up speaking mostly about Block Academy, and my experience creating it. This was fitting, since Humber College sent me to the conference, and Block Academy was largely done as part of my coursework while in school. The talk went well, and I ended up spending most of the rest of my saturday talking with people who wanted to know more about Block Academy or me, which was awesome. The Toronto gamedev community is nothing if not friendly.</p>

<p>The highlight of the weekend was definitely the Papo &amp; Yo talk. It’s great that there are people like Caballero finding success in the industry. A lot of talk about the future of video games revolves around the technology behind them, and not enough is about the future of storytelling, or of video games as a means of artistic expression. As Vander put it, the way we make games (putting poly counts and mechanics ahead of emotional experience and story) is broken. The idea that video games need to be treated as more than just amusing toys is something that I talk and think about a lot, and it’s great that theres room in the industry for that point of view to be profitable.</p>

<p>Getting to see the games being created in Toronto was a lot of fun as well. There were a number of devs there showcasing games they were building for blind gamers. Hearing them talk about having to design games to be fun (as opposed to just being playable) for the blind was eye opening. I, perhaps naively, hadn’t thought about the idea that there could be some game tropes that wouldn’t translate well to audio only games. One example of this was mazes. Although mazes are something that work very well with audio only games, the devs there shared that in all their play tests, they found that the feeling of being lost was something that just wasn’t fun for blind gamers. This makes sense once you hear it of course, but it was eye opening to hear them talk about their work.</p>

<p>I also had a chance to sit in on a couple of the hands-on workshops. The first was a 1 hour board game jam in which the task was to create a naval war game. My group’s design philosophy was to reject any form of complexity and just find new and unfair ways to kick the crap out of each other, and yet somehow we still managed to integrate kareoke into the mechanics. I’d do another one of these lightning board game creation sessions in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>The last workshop I attended was a 1 hour physics jam put on by Humber College. It was a lot of fun, but I wish I had spent my time over with the “dreamers” at the chalkboard thinking up crazy mechanics instead of with the programmers all desperately trying to get something working in an hour.</p>

<p>All in all, a freaking awesome weekend. Now go play Papo &amp; Yo, and get back to me with your thoughts about it.</p>
