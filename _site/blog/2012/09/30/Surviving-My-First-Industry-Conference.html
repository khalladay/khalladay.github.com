<h1 class="title">Surviving My First Industry Conference</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>You know the feeling you get about an hour after you realize that you’re way outside of your depth? That sinking feeling in your stomach? That was me about 10 seconds after agreeing to fill in at the last minute for a speaker at the most recent FITC Screens conference.</p>

<p>It all started with an email. Not to me, but to one of the designers at BNOTIONS, who was already scheduled to talk at the conference. Did anyone know a Unity developer that would be willing to fill in for a cancelled speaker? About 10 seconds after the email was sent, I had sent an email back saying that I would fill in. I wouldn’t begin crapping my pants for at least another 30 minutes, when news of my upcoming talk was shared with the rest of the engineering team, and it suddenly dawned on me that I had just agreed to give the biggest presentation I had ever given, to a room filled almost exclusively with developers far more experienced than me.</p>

<p>And so, the pants soiling began.</p>

<p>Perhaps atypically for a developer, I have no qualms about public speaking. My early school years were peppered with speech competitions, and throughout college I was known for being able to present anything, a valuable trait in a program filled with programmers. Despite this however, the thought of speaking to a room of much more experienced developers scared the pants off of me. Mostly, it was a fear of being simply not experienced enough to be interesting enough. I kept having visions of speaking to a room that slowly emptied over the course of the hour I had to talk. This didn’t subside until about 30 minutes AFTER I had finished speaking.</p>

<p>None of this made building the presentation any easier, especially since I hadn’t actually written a presentation since my last speech competition (the eighth grade). My standard MO for talks since then has been to write down a list of bullet points on a scrap of paper and improvise, but that wouldn’t work here. Improvising requires confidence, something I was sorely lacking when it came to this talk. It ended up taking me a little more than a week to fully plan out what I was going to say, and find slides to match.</p>

<p>That left only a few days to practice the talk in it’s entirety. Which I quickly learned, wasn’t going to be nearly as much as I would have liked. When your talk is an hour long, practicing it twice is a good chunk of your evening, and a sore/dry throat. Tea became my best friend while i talked to no one in particular for hours on end, and hoped that the walls in my apartment building were soundproof enough that I wasn’t driving anyone except my budgie insane with all the repetition.</p>

<p>Then came the day of the presentation. I wish I hadn’t been so nervous, as I missed out on two sessions that I really would have liked to go to out of nerves (the one immediately before my talk, and immediately after as I sat and tried to collect myself). I spent all morning in the presenter’s lounge drinking large quantities of coffee while repeating the words to my presentation under my breath and quickly looking up things that might get asked in the q&amp;a. Coffee was definitely not a good idea. Nervous twitching amplified by coffee makes my hyperactive, which would have been disastrous if not for my ability to overcome nerves so bad that I wanted to puke and give a halfway decent talk. As it turned out, I think said hyperactivity may have been directly responsible for the compliments I got for being “enthusiastic.” (enthusiastic from the latin root “Enthusilius,” meaning the act of desperately trying not to crap yourself in front of a room of colleagues).</p>

<p>What ended up being my saving grace, both in finding things to talk about for an hour, and in keeping a room full of developers interested in what I was saying was that what I do is relatively odd, even to developers. Augmented Reality is still a fairly niche pursuit, and augmented reality games are (as my talk elaborated on) still a rare sight to see. Even better, I had spent the weeks leading up to the talk working on r&amp;d with some of the most cutting edge tech that the world of Mobile AR has available to it right now. Even better, 3D augmented reality hasn’t been around that long on mobile phones, which meant that only having a year and a half’s worth of experience wasn’t as much of a disadvantage as it seemed at first glance.</p>

<p>And obviously, from the rather lighthearted tone of this post, the talk went really well. No one walked out on me, lots of people ended up flagging me down afterwards to talk even more, and I’m proud to say, I didn’t end up needing to change pants.</p>

<p>And so, to end off this post with a list (which I seem to like doing), I hereby present the top 3 things that I learned from all of this:</p>

<p>Go to the bathroom. Seriously.
Despite the jokes at my bowel’s expense above, this was a real issue that made my talk that much harder to deliver. Just like exams, make sure to go before you have to go on, there’s nothing worse than trying to give an interview to a reporter while prairie dogging.</p>

<h3 id="start-simple">Start Simple</h3>
<p>Assume your audience knows NOTHING about what you’re talking about, and then build up to the more interesting things you have to say. I was lucky, AR is different enough that it would be unreasonable to expect developers who don’t work with it to know anything about it, so I had to start off from ground zero. Other presenters at FITC weren’t that lucky. One unlucky guy had to change his talk on the fly when he realized that no one in his room had even installed the software that he was talking about. Don’t be that guy, unless you think you can pull off improvising an hour long presentation. That guy has my utmost respect, but I guarantee that given the choice, he would have preferred to have planned for that audience beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="get-enthusiastic">Get Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Drink coffee until you puke if you have too, but for the sake of your audience, please be psyched about what you’re talking about. We spend all day behind our computers, so it’s definitely understandable that you may not be the most dynamic presenter in the world, but even the most interesting content in the world is boring as hell if you’re monotone and don’t move around a bit. If you’re excited about your content, your audience will be too  (it worked for me)</p>

<p>Alright, that’s it for this wall of text. Got a tip for giving a talk? Ever crapped yourself in front of a paying audience? Grab me on twitter!</p>
