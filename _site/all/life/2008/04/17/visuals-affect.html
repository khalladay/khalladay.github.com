<h2>Visuals Affect</h2>
<p class="publish_date">17 Apr 2008</p>
<p>Found <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/">these comics</a> the other day.  I didn&#8217;t get or like most of them but this one is excellent:</p>
<p><img src="http://communicatopia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/didnt-forget-sound-effects.gif" alt="power point" class="scoot" /></p>
<p>I used to think Power Point was evil.  In a way I guess I still do.  I use Keynote instead of Power Point but they both make it way too easy to make a really bad presentation.  Text and bullet points are the path of least resistance and will be travelled most frequently.</p>
<p>Whenever I create a presentation I enforce constraints on myself that make it challenging and hopefully less boring for my audiences.  One of them is: No bullet points allowed.  If you have a list of things to say don&#8217;t write them on the slide and read them to me.  Give me something to look at while you <i>tell</i> me.  </p>
<p>I ask &#8220;Is there any word on the slide that I cannot get rid of?&#8221;  It&#8217;s my mouth&#8217;s job to say the words &#8211; my mouth can&#8217;t display pictures, charts, and diagrams.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t use clipart&#8230; Mostly because I detest it but it&#8217;s nice to know that it isn&#8217;t even part of Keynote.</p>
<p>Ok, here are some examples.  I was present an implementation plan for three technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast Iron Integration Appliance</li>
<li>Data Warehouse</li>
<li>Ruby On Rails</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of the bullet points like you see above here is the slide I created:<br />
<img alt="Cast Iron, DW, Rails" src="http://communicatopia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/castiron-dw-rails.png" class="scoot" /></p>
<p>I was presenting a new architecture plan and got done explaining the problems with our current setup.  The next slide was to describe the consequences.  I could have used this bullet list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frustrated users</li>
<li>Upset managers</li>
<li>Unhappy developers</li>
</ul>
<p>My slide:<br />
<img alt="Cast Iron, DW, Rails" src="http://communicatopia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sadusersetc.png" class="scoot" /></p>
<p>There were three kinds of reports that were going to be migrated to a new environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>All New Reports</li>
<li>Problematic Reports</li>
<li>Reports which need major enhancements</li>
</ul>
<p>My Slide:<br />
<img alt="What to move" src="http://communicatopia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/carslide.png" class="scoot" /></p>
<p>I think adding visuals helps a lot.  They get attention, they create memories.  </p>
<p>Sometimes you might have a list of abstract elements that can&#8217;t be described pictorially.  I was trying to make a slide for the end of one of my presentations where we discussed a list of requests we have received that were potential candidates to do next in Ruby on Rails.  There were 11 projects to choose from and software that hasn&#8217;t been written yet is very difficult to photograph.  Some projects seemed more likely than others.  Here is what I did:<br />
<img alt="Tag Cloud" src="http://communicatopia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/rails-candidates.png" class="scoot" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a traditional bullet list &#8211; it&#8217;s more like a tag cloud.  The more likely/important names are larger.</p>
<p>Presentation software makes it easy for users to make very bad presentations but there are ways to defeat them.</p>
