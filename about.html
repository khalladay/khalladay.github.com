<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://www.spokt.com/" class="pink">spokt.com</a> to help my family keep in touch.  We use it and love it and many other families do as well.  I have built websites for clients and have held full time development jobs in IT as well.</p>

<p>I like creating software because I've always dreamed of being an inventor and solving problems.  Software lets me carry out that dream in a small way and perhaps someday in a big way.</p>

<p>You may email me: dan [at!] spokt [dot!] com</p>
