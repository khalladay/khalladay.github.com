I can’t help but feel a little relieved that February is over, because it means that I can stop working on the month’s 1GAM project and take stock of where I’m at, and what happened this month. It’s been a rough month, with lots of disappointment and soul searching, but probably also a lot of hard earned lessons that are good to have gotten into my system now.

Did I finish a game this month? No, and it’s a hard pill to swallow. The reasons for this are many, but seeing as the tagline for the One Game a Month challenge is “make games, not excuses,” I’ll spare you the drawn out tale of what exactly went wrong. The short of it is: I unwittingly got drawn into writing an engine, and by the time I realized that’s what I was doing, it was too late to salvage the month’s game. I did manage to build a tutorial level, which implements (VERY roughly) a lot of the ideas that Johannes and I had planned for this month’s game, but it’s a far cry from the original concept.

But rather than a tale of woe, I’d rather write about what I learned this month:

 

* *Make sure you aren’t writing an engine (unless that’s what you want to be doing)*

I didn’t think I would ever make this mistake. How could I? I knew better than to try to write my own engine, I’ve been trying at making games for 3.5 years now (good god has it really been that long? I feel like I should have much more to my name by now), of course I’ve heard this advice repeated before, I’ve even given it myself. I fell into this pit without even realizing it, and learned a valuable lesson in the process:  if you’re writing more “framework” code than specific to your game code, you’re writing an engine. Don’t think you’re immune to this happening just because you know this is a common pitfall, because I certainly wasn’t.

 

* *Everything takes twice as long as you think it will. Plan accordingly.*

Some of you will remember this lesson from last month. It seems I hadn’t fully learned my lesson yet. Estimation is hard, and accurate estimation is a problem being tackled by software engineers everywhere. Games are no different. EVERYTHING will take longer than you expect it to. The only reasonable solution is to either plan to take more time to achieve what you want, or (in the case of something like 1GAM), plan to do less. For us, this means attempting our core idea again in March, but with all the extraneous mechanics and game features removed. This makes sense for more reasons than just timing. Keeping the mechanics in a game limited ensures that your game is a more cohesive whole, and reduces the risk of feature creep. Especially for small indie teams, doing 1 very small game concept well is infinitely better than half implementing a dozen features. One scenario ends with a finished game, one ends with crap.

No seriously, go read the last header again. This is important. YOUR IDEA IS TOO BIG, GO MAKE IT SMALLER.

 

* *Embrace any tools that make it easier to do what you love.*

This lesson may be more specific to me than the rest, but it’s probably the most important thing I came to terms with this month. I started 1GAM with the intention of using Ogre/Bullet for everything. This decision was motivated by a lot of different factors, but none of them was that I needed Ogre/Bullet to make the games I want to make. It took failing a month of 1GAM to realize how wrong this thinking was. I don’t dream of making engines, or writing frameworks; I spend all my free time working on, thinking about, and playing games because making games is what makes me happy, and from now on, any tool, engine, or process that makes it easier to make the games I want to make is going to be added to my workflow.

 

So what’s in store for next month? Hopefully a finished game, and possibly a blog post sometime before the end of the month (I have lots of things I mean to write about, I just never get around to doing it), no promises though, except that I’ll try my best to get there, and  hopefully along the way will learn just as much as I did this month.
