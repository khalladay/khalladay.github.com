I’ve been playing around with the Kinect this month (I love that thing). I’ve used it in the past with some gesture control and image processing at work, but I hadn’t really considered it as an option for gamedev, mostly because I don’t have an xbox sdk. I’ve been trying to think of cool ways to use it though, lest it become the coolest dust collector I have in my apartment, and I think I’m on to something this month 

As you’ve probably gathered from my other work, I suck at visual art, and it’s probably my least favourite thing to work on when making a game, so any time I can find a cool way to simplify that process I jump on it (why do you think I got into augmented reality?). This month I’ve been experimenting with capturing the output from a kinect and using that in place of 3D models. It may not be useful for all situations, but the results are pretty cool, don’t you think?
