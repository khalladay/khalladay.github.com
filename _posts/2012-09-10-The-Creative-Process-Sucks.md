title: The Creative Process Sucks

Can programmers get writer’s block? You bet they can!

For about the past month, I’ve been suffering from the most debilitating case of it that I’ve ever encountered. Namely, trying to decide what to do for my next project.

I’m the first to admit that I’m a little bit high strung, curse of the chronic overachiever I guess, and the real problem with this decision is that it’s the first game that I will have made as something other than a student. It’s not for a mark, or to enter into a competition, or to gain experience, its sole purpose is to be fun.

It’s scary as hell. I’m very good at getting marks, and hitting deadlines, and building a portfolio, but as the recent release of Block Academy shows, I’m a total amateur at actually building fun, and now that i’ve graduated, all those things that I’m good at seem inconsequential.

Finding a game designer is one option, but I don’t know any of them, and I’m hesitant to jump into a project with an unproven game designer that I’ve never met, and, being an unproven game developer that they’ve never met, I don’t expect any of them to be comfortable with that arrangement either. Building a game is a long, hard process, and finding a random designer to work with seems too much like gambling for my liking.

So I’ve been stuck; xkcd would have described me as being “nerd sniped.” Thinking up a game concept has consumed all of my free time, probably to the detriment of my creative ability. Thankfully, I can say all of this in the past tense, as of about 15 minutes ago. I have an idea, one that I’m going to start building tonight, which I’ll talk about once I have something to show about it.

For now though, for the one of you that may be still reading this, let me leave you with what I’ve found helpful through this long, long process.

### Think about verbs ###

I didn’t start getting anywhere until I stopped thinking about game mechanics in the traditional sense. Those of us who have grown up with games have been inundated with what a mechanic is, and it’s limiting to think in that way. Thinking about what the user is going to do in your game as a high concept instead of exact implementation really really helped. It’s the subtle difference between thinking like “I’m going to make a puzzle platformer involving walking on light,” and “I want to make a game that lets users interact with light as though it’s a solid,” but it made a world of difference for me.

### Environment is important ###

Some people, heretofore referred to as “lucky pricks,” get flashes of creative brilliance at random times. The rest of us have to work for it, hard. Where you do this work is important, because where you are influences how you think. I spent a large chunk of time sitting on my couch with a pen and paper, and got nowhere. Sitting at my piano, and playing random chords while thinking seemed to help. If you find yourself stuck in the same rut as me, try changing where you do your thinking.

### Find an idol, then idolize them ###

Find a successful game designer (or designers) that you want to be like, scratch that, find the guy/gal that is building games that make you wish you had built it, and then learn from them. Play their games, watch their interviews, read their blogs, and figure out how they approach game design. For me, these designers were Edmund McMillen, Will Wright, and to a lesser extent, Jonathon Blow.

I can honestly say that I’ve watched every talk, or interview, or lecture that is on youtube by these three guys, and have learned very different things from each of them. Athletes grow up wanting to be and learning from their favourite athletes, writers learn from their favourite writers, why should game designers be any different?

 

Take all of this with a grain of salt, as this post describes in excruciating detail, I’m terrible at being creative (at least in terms of game design), but if it helps you out, more power to you! I’m gonna go build my game now.
